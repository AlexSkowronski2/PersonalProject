# PersonalProject
This is where I will create my code for my personal project hehe
This will also consist of a to-do-do list:
- set-up the API
- continue to populate the database with more exercises
- set-up the front-end to handle GET requests
- Use SQL to make a clear endpoint to show the muscles and movement patterns without the ids
- set up the classes of: Days, Exercises (containing sets, reps, RPE), Weeks (stick to syncronous), stick to one mesocycle
- Plan user workout database (within the OG database): workout day as the general one
- linking to exercises performed by user
- want it to be done by updating rows of the database?
- implement last set AMRAP,
